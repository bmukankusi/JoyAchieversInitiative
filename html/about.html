        <p>Joy Achievers Initiative is a youth-led non-profit organization dedicated to addressing issues 
          of street life, family conflict, and unwanted pregnancies in young ladies, and creating joyful 
          environments for children. Our goal is to end street children altogether.</p>
         <p> According to the World Health Organization, there are 150 million street children worldwide. 
          In Rwanda, UNICEF estimates that there are 7,000 street children. Of these, 73% have suffered 
          from mental disorders before coming to the street, and the remaining 27% develop mental 
          disorders on the street due to the stigma and anxiety they face. </p>
         <p> Our organization is composed of individuals who are skilled in mental health and care. We aim 
          to make a positive impact on the community by building joyful families for children and treating 
          the mental health of children by removing them from street life and returning them to their 
          families and schools. </p>
